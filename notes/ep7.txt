What will you learn:

- Routing (Basically how to create multiple pages on your site)

- If no dependency array in useEffect => useEffect is called on every render
- If dependency array is empty => useEffect is called on initial render(just once)
- If there is somethig in dependency array => useEffect is called everytime when the thing mentioned in the dependency array is updated.

- React applications are known as single page applications.

# 2 types of routing in web apps:
- Client Side Routing: No network call will be made, we already have the component for /about, so it will just load the About component.
- Server Side Routing: In this if we go to /about then a Network Request will be made to fetch the About page from the server.
