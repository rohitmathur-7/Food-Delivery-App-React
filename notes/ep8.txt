React Lifecycle:
----------------------------------------------------------------

- ComponentDidMount: Used to make API Calls.

(1 parent 1 child)
Parent Constructor -> Parent Render -> Child Constructor -> Child Render -> Child ComponentDidMount -> Parent ComponentDidMount

(1 parent 2 or n childs)
Parent Constructor -> Parent Render -> Child1 Constructor -> Child1 Render ->  Child2 Constructor -> Child2 Render -> Child1 ComponentDidMount -> Child2 ComponentDidMount -> Parent ComponentDidMount

Lifecycle is divided into two phases:

1) Render Phase: Constructor and Render method takes place. (Batched together for all childs)
2) Commit Phase: This is batched together for all the childs as DOM manipulation takes time, so it is only done once for all the childs. (Batched together for all childs)
