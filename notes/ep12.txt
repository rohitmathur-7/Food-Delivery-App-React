Add to cart functionality:
----------------------------------------------------------------
* For Writing to the Redux store:
- When we click on add button it dispatches an action that calls a function and this function will
  internally modify the cart.
  - This function which modifies the cart is known as reducer.

  Add(button) --> Action(dispatch) --> Reducer Function --> Store


* For Reading from the Redux store:
- We will use a Selector which will give us the data from the Redux store.(This phenomenon is know as "Subscribing to the Store".)
- If we want to show data in the Header component from the Redux store then we will do it using a Selector and this will be called "Header is Subscribed to the Store using Selector".
 
  Store --> Selector --> Header Component get updated AutoMagically.
